## Personal website

This is my personal website created from the scratch using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap library (version 4.4.1). The site also uses a pinch of JavaScript and PHP code for some visual effects and to provide interactivity with user.

Due to Bootstrap based structure, site is mobile friendly and has a fully responsive design. Project was tested by validators provided on https://w3c.github.io/developers/tools/ and showed no errors.

###### Contact form

Email sending by contact form is managed by [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) code library (version 6.1.5) distributed under the LGPL 2.1 [license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html). Form fields validation is done by jQuery Validation plugin (version 1.19.1) working under 3.5.1. version of jQuery. Custom server and client side validation is provided as well.

###### Visual effects

Website mainly uses features provided by the Bootstrap library. Some effects are realized by the use of CSS transition property and some simple JavaScript scripts.
